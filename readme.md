# Jellyfin-Sandbox

This GitHub Org is used as staging and development area of the new and *hopefully* improoved CI for the main Jellyfin project repositories.
Any repositories, tags, releases or artifacts found in here are considered as increments and NOT SUPPORTED versions.
We use this Org to build and validate the workflows we aim to deploy soon to the actual Jellyfin Org.
While we appreciate community contributions here too, please keep in mind that CI is a delicate area where we cannot accept everything without proper validation and discussion.

Other than that happy sneakpeeking at the new workflows and parutally new repos as we develop them :wink:
